## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text into beautiful static websites and blogs. It's simple, fast, and secure, as it doesn't require a database or server-side processing.

## Key Features

1. **Markdown Support**: Write your content in Markdown format
2. **Built-in Support**: Comes with:
   - Syntax highlighting
   - RSS feed
   - Blog-aware features

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python code example with syntax highlighting:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Simple greeting function"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Test the function
print(greet("World"))
```

## Adding Images

You can easily add images to your posts. Here's the Jekyll logo (if you had one):
